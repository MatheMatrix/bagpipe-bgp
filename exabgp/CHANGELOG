Version 2.1.0 - -- of ----- 2012 (experimental version)
 * API Change: send "up" message to worker process when neighbor OPEN negociation is complete (not on TCP up)
 * API Addition: send "connected" to worker when neighbor TCP session is established (replace previous 'up')
 * Fix: reset counters correctly for number of routes seen (only affects the logs)

    requested by jonlooney (with a patch - thank you)
 * Fix: when the pid file could not be written, the daemon was crashing on exit

Version 1.3.3 - 25th of June 2011
 * Improvement: massive speed improvement when reloading with many routes (60 to 2 seconds with 10k routes)
    reported by Martin Baum (with proof of concept patch)

Version 1.3.2 - 23rd of June 2011
 * Fix bug where we would not wait long enough for OPEN/KEEPALIVE messages on startup
    reported by: Yann Berthier

Version 1.3.1 - 3rd of May 2011
 * Fix bug in configuration parsing introduce just before 1.3.0
 * Improvement: make tcp-server implement all the internal API available

Version 1.3.0 - 2nd of May 2011

 * Fix: introduced a bug in neighbor printing
 * Fix: we were trying to send a KEEPALIVE after the initial routes, but it was not going
 * Fix: a work around a python bug with TCP was not implemented everywhere
 * Improvement: adding a 'ttl-security' to allow to explicit setup of TCP TTL

 * Improvement: it is now possible to modify the configuration without reload from external proccess (see process example conf.)
    warning: this code is not yet considered production ready, expect some bugs for complex configurations
 * Fix: make sure we can setup a session even if no route (ie: AFI/SAFI families for Mulitprotocol) are in the configuration
 * Fix: many small bug fixes, simple code refactorisation, ...

Version 1.2.0 - 25th of January 2011
 * Improvement: Allow to break route in more specific (ie define a /22 and get 4x /24 announced)
                This is useful when blackholing traffic to make sure no routes more specific are received from your network peer/transit
    requested by : Renaud Chaput
 * Improvement: Save the program PID into a file (set the PID= environment value with the file path)
    requested by : Renaud Chaput
 * Improvement: Add syslog support (env SYSLOG= nothing for local syslog, a file name (auto-rotate) or host:<host> for remote syslog)
    requested by : Josh Ward
 * Improvement: Can now daemonise (env DAEMON= detach and send the program in the background)
    requested by : Josh Ward
 * Improvement: Selection of what subsystems to log, more readable logs (well, less unreadeable to be exact)

 * Fix: some change to the AS_PATH generation code (some routers did not accept empty AS_PATH as it was encoded before)
    reported by: R.P. Aditya
 * Fix: some interoperability issue with openbgpd (could not parse their OPEN message)
    (issue 1) reported by Manuel Guesdon
 * Experimental: Some MD5 for Linux (untested - surely not working)

 * Fix: missing default localpref on IBGP session if not specified on the route
 * Improvement: more verbose messages in case of OPEN negociation issue
 * Fix: typo preventing 4 Bytes ASN to work

Version 1.0.2 - 22nd of October 2010
 * Improvement: only try to generate UPDATE messages if the configuration was changed (save quite some CPU as the algorithm is really naive)
 * Fix : a neighbor configuration change could have been undetected on SIGHUP/SIGALRM
    reported by: Yann Berthier
 * Fix : reloading the configuration did not detect the removed routes 
    reported by Renaud Chaput
 * Fix : a bug in the format of the UPDATE for route withdrawal causing Cisco (and not Quagga) to tear the session
    reported by Renaud Chaput

Version 1.0.1 - 7th of September 2010
 * Fixes an issue with some python versions (at least 2.5.2) when sending a large number of routes (several hundred). Some messages could be sent in multiple parts, causing the parser at the other end to barf (Thank you to Renaud Chaput for the bug report)
