ROADMAP

Version 2.1.0
- usual bug fixes and improvments
- add full support for multisession (this is too intrusive to still call 2.0.xx stable)
- http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-extended-messages-02.txt
- an exception interception wrapper so forked process do not die on signal sent to exabgp
- have a command to shutdown the process properly

LATER
- usual bug fixes and improvments
